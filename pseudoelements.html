        <h1> Text Formating</h1>


        <div>
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
        HTML describes the structure of a Web page
        HTML consists of a series of elements
        HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
        HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
        </div>

            <div class="one">Applications of HTML</div><br><br>

<h2>1.Structuring web pages</h2>
<p>With tags and elements, we can define the headings, paragraphs, and other contents of a web page. 
Browsers come with a built-in stylesheet that visually differentiates these elements. 
Content surrounded with  tags will have a large, bolded font and its own line.
Surrounding text with  tags will make it bold and slightly smaller than the  elements, and so on. 
Without these tags, the text on the web page would all look the same.</p><br><br><hr>

        

<h2>2.Navigating the internet</h2>
<p> the internet would be much harder without HTML.
 Imagine having to manually enter the URL of every web page you wanted to visit. 
This would be our reality without anchor tags. 
HTML's anchor tags allow us to link pages to and from each other using the href attribute.
</p>
          <br><br><hr>

         
<h2>3.Embedding images and videos</h2>
<p>HTML also allows you to not only embed images into a webpage but also adjust their width, height, position, and even the way they're rendered.
In the past, developers would use Flash to embed videos into a webpage. 
But, with HTML5's addition of the video tag, that's no longer necessary.
Along with embedding videos, you can use other HTML attributes to adjust video controls, timestamps, thumbnails, autoplay, and more.
</p>
        <br><br>
<h2>4.Improving client-side data storage and offline capabilities</h2>
 <p> 
HTML5 also improved the language's offline capabilities. Websites use cookies to store data about users that can be retrieved later when they revisit the site. 
Cookies work well for small data like authentication tokens and usernames, but HTML5's addition of localStorage and IndexDB enabled browsers to store more complex data.
Plus, the application cache and cache manifest files you can reference from HTML allow users to browse a website while offline by retaining data on the user's machine.
This allows your web app to continue functioning even if a user's connection drops.
</p><br><br<br>

<h2> 5.Game development </h2>
<p>
While you can't create video games purely with HTML, the canvas element makes it possible to build video games in your browser using CSS and JavaScript. 
In the past, you could only do this with Flash or Silverlight. But with modern HTML. 
you can create both 2D and 3D games that run in your browser.
</p><br><br>

<h2>6.Interacting with native APIs</h2>
<p>
Another feature of HTML is that it can interact with your operating system, not just with your web browser. 
These features make it possible to drag files onto a web page to upload them, full-screen a video, and more.

        <h1>Overflow</h1>
<pre> main parts of our element are as follows:

opening tag: 
This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. 
This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
The closing tag: 
This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. 
This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. 
Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
The content: 
This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
The element: 
The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</pre>

<h1>CSS</h1>
<img class="two" src="web.png" alt="Computer" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">
<h3>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.

CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. 
Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</h3>

    Advantages of web app development:</h1>
    <h4>

Runs on any OS:</h4> Its programmed to run on any OS . It must appropriately adapt to iOS, Android, and Windows Phone — amongst other operating systems.
Runs using easy URL: These apps run on the devices own browser through an easy URL.
Need not be downloaded: They dont got to be downloaded and installed from app stores like Google Play or Apples App Store. 
This translates into money-saving since having an immediate link through an internet app is free.
Need not be updated like apps: They may also open websites. This suggests that they dont require to be updated within the way common apps do.
Cost Efficient: The most important benefit you’ll draw faraway from it’s its price. 
Web app development is that the cheaper quite app development. 
It consists of making a link or several links between the appliance and an URL. 
Developing a native app or an interpreted app entails a better cost but its chances to succeed are far greater.
